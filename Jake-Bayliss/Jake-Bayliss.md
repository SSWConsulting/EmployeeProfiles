Jake is a Software Architect originally from New Zealand, now working out of Sydney. He has worked with a wide range of technologies, including .NET, React, SQL, Power BI and Azure. He has a huge passion for creating progressive web apps using the latest tech stack.

Jake has built many well-presented, client-facing Power BI reports with a story-telling twist and loves pushing Power BI to it's limits. He loves creating custom visuals for use in Power BI - if there is a visual that doesn't exist yet, then Jake would love to build it himself!
