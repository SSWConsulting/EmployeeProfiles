Jake is a Software Architect originally from New Zealand, now working out of Sydney. He works with a wide range of technologies, including .NET, React, SQL, the Power Platform and Azure. He has a huge passion for creating progressive web apps using the latest tech stack.

Jake has built many well-presented, client-facing Power BI reports with a story-telling twist and loves pushing Power BI to it's limits. He loves creating custom visuals for use in Power BI - if there is a visual that doesn't exist yet, then Jake would love to build it himself!

When Jake isn't working you'll find him doing 1 of 5 things: playing football, chess, surfing, in the gym or doing a home project/learning a new tech.
