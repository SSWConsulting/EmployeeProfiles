Tiago is our favourite creative genius. When he told us he wanted to move back to Brazil, we said: "Ok, but you're still working for us". We couldn't let him go.  

Tiago is a creative individual who enjoys a challenge. He has five years experience working as a designer for both print and web projects. He also loves spending time playing with Photoshop while listening to old songs. Here are some of his skills:

*   Development of Internet/Multimedia solutions, ranging from concept, project, layout, development and implementation;
*   Image editing and optimization aiming usage at either printed or digital media;
*   Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Acrobat, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, Silverlight, CorelDraw, XHTML, CSS and jQuery

Besides SSW's design enhancement projects, Tiago's past clients include Energy Australia, FastAs, WorleyParsons, The Home Loan Company and Carmody Group.

 * **Tiago's CSS quick tip***

 *Did you know you can combine properties?*

 *Some properties as padding, margin and border have been split. For example, padding has padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left. If the possibility exists, you should always combine these properties, making it easier to edit and saving you space too:*

*  
*

*<font color="#808080">padding-left:0 ;  padding-top:20px;  padding-bottom:25px;  padding-right:4px;</font>  
*<em style="font-family:" segoe="" ui",="" segoe,="" tahoma,="" helvetica,="" arial,="" sans-serif;"="">  
*</em>

<em style="font-family:" segoe="" ui",="" segoe,="" tahoma,="" helvetica,="" arial,="" sans-serif;"="">to**  
*</em>

*<font color="#808080">  
</font>*

*<font color="#808080">padding:20px 4px 25px 0;</font>*

*  
*

 *When the bottom/top values are the same and the left-right values as well, you can optimize it even more:*

*<font color="#808080">  
</font>*

*<font color="#808080">padding-top:10px;  padding-bottom:10px;  padding-left:0 ;  padding-right:0px;</font>  

*

*to  
<font color="#808080">  
</font>*

*<font color="#808080">padding:10px 0;</font>*
