Matt built SSW's Rewards mobile app in Xamarin.Forms to help [gamify SSW's swag](https://adamcogan.com/2019/11/06/ssw-had-fun-at-ndc-gotta-catch-em-all/) for NDC Sydney in 2019.

The app enables the developer community to connect with SSW devs at conferences and user group events, as well as accumulate points by scanning QR codes and ultimately winning prizes. It also features a tech quiz that let's developer test themselves. Matt also worked with the team on the backend of the app, and the entire product was built and released in under two weeks.

Relevant technologies: .NET Core, Azure Functions, Azure AD B2C, Xamarin
