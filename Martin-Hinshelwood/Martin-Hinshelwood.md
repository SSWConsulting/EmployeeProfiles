Some of Martin’s highlights have been:

*   **TFS2010 Beta 2 Migration   

    **Martin was on the team that gave SSW the distinction of being the [<font color="#000080">first</font>](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2009/10/25/deploying-visual-studio-2010-team-foundation-server-beta-2.aspx) company in the world to be in production with Visual Studio 2010 Team Foundation Server. 
*   **TFS2010 RC Migration   

    **Again SSW was the [<font color="#000080">first</font>](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2010/02/10/upgrading-from-tfs-2010-beta-2-to-tfs-2010-rc.aspx) company in the world, outside of Microsoft, to deploy the Visual Studio 2010 Team Foundation Server to production. Martin used his expertise of migrating process templates and updating the SharePoint portal. 
*   **First Scrum project at SSW   

    **Martin was involved in finally removing the 'scrum buts' so SSW could use the good engineering practices of Scrum at 100%.   

    Related Technology: Team Foundation Server, Scrum, Team Build, Team Test 
*   **SSW SQL Deploy   

    **Updating SSW’s SQL Deploy so that it supported Silverlight 4.  

    Related Technology: Silverlight, MVVM, IoC, WCF 

Martin’s open source projects:

*   **TFS Event Handler**   

    If you assign someone a work item, they should always receive an email. The [<font color="#000080">TFS Event Handler</font>](http://tfseventhandler.codeplex.com/) makes it easier to notify users of changes to Work Items in Team Foundation Server. You will no longer need to add individual alerts to users.   

    Related Technology: Team Foundation Server, VB.NET, WCF, Windows Services 
*   **TFS Sticky Buddy   

    **[<font color="#000080">TFS Sticky Buddy</font>](http://tfsstickybuddy.codeplex.com/) makes it easier for all members of the development team to visualise the current state of their project by utilising a graphical view of Work Items. (Only for TFS 2005 & 2008. This is not relevant in VS2010 since Telerik’s work item manager has taken this idea to next step.)
