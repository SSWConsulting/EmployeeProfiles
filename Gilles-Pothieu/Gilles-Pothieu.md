Gilles is a SSW Software Developer at SSW Europe (France), who has been working with the Angular/.NET Core environment for nearly 4 years. Being curious, he enjoys using his free time to explore new technologies by both creating small applications to learn new programming languages and experimenting with emerging frameworks.

He started his career as a web developer before joining an engineering team working on a large application for an insurance company.   
Patient and passionate, Gilles enjoys creating responsive applications with user-friendly and optimized UX as much as he enjoys architecting a back-office.
