Gordon is a Senior Software Developer at SSW specialising in software best practices.

He has over 10 years of experience in IT, primarily from the financial sector with Microsoft technologies, but makes use of other free and proprietary tools and environments as needed (e.g. FreeBSD, OS X, Linux, Apache, Ruby, NAnt, xUnit, Cygwin, Emacs, LLBLGen, ReSharper)

You can visit Gordon's [blog](http://www.informationisnotknowledge.com/) and his poor excuse for a [website](http://www.gordonhartley.com/) (warning - contains cute kitten photo's).

His favourite quote is *"Information is not knowledge". *
