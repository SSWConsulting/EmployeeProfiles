Joe first discovered the wonders of coding as an impressionable 7 year old who stumbled across a BASIC interpreter on his copy of PC-DOS. Later, a similar revolution was to occur when he first encountered the world of .NET after downloading the first public alpha released to the public back in 2000.

With strong experience in web-based application development, Joe's had experience in a wide variety of situations - from on-the-ground development on high-traffic ASP.NET public websites through to developing system architectures from the ground up. In recent years he has developed a keen interest in user experience and enjoys exploring ways to make software more intuitive and enjoyable for users. A strong background in creative arts merged with his technical experience has helped contribute to the look and feel of sites like [WorleyParsons](http://www.worleyparsons.com/) and [Microsoft SharePoint Forum](http://www.microsoftsharepoint.com/).

When he's not helping SSW build great software, you're likely to find him working as a [music producer and writer](http://joe.hardy.id.au/), seeing live music, drinking a latte or enjoying spending time with his wife and daughter.
