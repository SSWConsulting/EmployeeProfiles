Sam is a Software Engineer at SSW. Coming from a background in low-level programming, but he has cut his teeth on web development using ASP.NET core, EF Core and Angular. He's also got experience with the Power Platform using PowerApps, PowerAutomate and Microsoft's Dataverse to build CRMs.

## .NET

Sam's loves building WebAPIs with ASP.NET Core, working to build the fastest, safest and most reliable backends he can.

## Angular

Front-End web development is a subtle love of Sam's. A sneaky designer at heart, he loves all the trials and tribulations that come with building a beautiful front-end.
