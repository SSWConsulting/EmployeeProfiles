David is a senior graphic designer, with a passion for creative digital design. His talent is in developing clever user interface designs (UI) using storyboards and prototypes to display his concepts. He loves building intuitive websites that give a great user experience.

David also has 15 years of experience as a cinematographer in the film industry, working for companies such as National Geographic, Discovery Channel and Europe's largest advertising agencies. He worked both behind the camera shooting footage and on the computer in VFX post production, creating documentaries that put dinosaurs in modern day New York City, amongst other things. David brings this experience with him to SSW TV where he helps with shooting and editing corporate videos.

In his spare time David can be found learning the latest creative apps or working on footage for Film Festivals.

 "The master of the art of living makes little distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation, his love and his religion. He hardly knows which is which; he simply pursues his vision of excellence in whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing. To him he is always doing both." - Buddha
