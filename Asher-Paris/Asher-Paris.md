Asher is a SSW copywriter and Marketing Assistant who loves anything and everything copywriting. Why? Because the opportunityisnowhere.

Asher cut his teeth working at FinTech startups during university. Once he finished his law degree, he was admitted to the Supreme Court of NSW and worked as a lawyer for a few years. He sued the government, protected franchiesees from banks and he fought crime with the aid of gadgets and vechiles to keep the city of Gotham safe ðŸ¦‡  

Asher gave up his stable career in law for the precarious life of an advertising and marketing copywriter. And he hasn't looked back since joining SSW in 2023!

- Creative Ideation

- Advertising 
- Marketing Strategy 
- Social Media Marketing
