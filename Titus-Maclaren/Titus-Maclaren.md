As a Multimedia Producer, it is Titus’s responsibility to produce and implement engaging videos, photos, graphic design, social media content and strategic marketing initiatives, in a new and ever evolving marketplace. Titus loves client work and is passionate about any project he takes on. Titus cares about finding bottlenecks in the video production process and has improved the turnaround time on videos by several days. This has allowed for not only an increase in production of SSW TV videos, but also videos advertising SSW’s services ([see Titus’s video on CRM](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/MicrosoftCRM.aspx)). Titus is an all-rounder with video and prides himself on being able to tackle any genre, however comedy is his favourite.
