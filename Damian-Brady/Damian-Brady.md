Damian is a Solution Architect and Microsoft Certified Professional who runs our Brisbane SSW Office.  



With over ten years of experience both in software development and business analysis roles, Damian has had exposure to a large number of industries including government and finance. A software architect with a wide skillset, he is able to use his excellent technical skills and knowledge of business process to deliver the most effective solutions to our clients.  



His main loves are helping Scrum teams run smoothly and effectively, and delivering great ASP.NET MVC web application. He has also had extensive experience in .Net WinForms applications, mobile-targeted websites, and SQL Server.  



Damian is very active in the Brisbane developer community and is a regular speaker at both the [Queensland MSDN](http://www.qmsdnug.org/ "Qld MSDN User Group") and [Queensland ALM](http://www.qalmug.org/ "Qld ALM User Group") user groups. He also runs the [DeveloperDeveloperDeveloper](http://www.dddbrisbane.com/ "DDD Brisbane") conference each year in Brisbane.  



In his spare time, Damian plays indoor volleyball for a club in Brisbane, and is an avid AFL supporter.   



Damian's client projects include:  

*   **Management Advantage - Mentoring and Development  

    
    **Management Advantage is a leading provider of aged care and clinical management software. Looking to move their legacy VB6 codebase to .Net and improve their software development process, they engaged SSW to help. Since coming on board, we've implemented an effective Scrum process, provided guidance on best practices for .Net development, and mentored the development team in both technical and process areas.
*   **Hong Kong Aviation Capital - New Website**  

    
    Together with Rebecca Liu, we created and deployed a new website based on the .Net Orchard CMS. This work included design and creation of unique components to facilitate specialist website functions.
*   **An Internal Management Application for a major electricity provider  

    
    **A long-running project, Damian came on board to help bring the software to completion.  Combining DynamicData, ASP.Net, and rich Silverlight interfaces, the solution was a powerful tool to help their management team.
