Eric is the ultimate Solution Architect. His wide range of technical skills, and deep knowledge of certain specialty technologies, mix well with his amiable manner and excellent communication skills.  

Eric is keen Solution Architect who doesn't mind a challenge. He has an in-depth knowledge of .NET and the Microsoft Stack. He came from the Java (J2SE & J2ME) world and values running strong teams, .NET architecture, unit testing and maintainable code via coding standards.

Eric is always on the cutting edge, using Microsoft's latest technologies before they are widely adopted. He also is a frequent presenter at user groups and technical breakfasts where he shares his experiences using these technologies.
