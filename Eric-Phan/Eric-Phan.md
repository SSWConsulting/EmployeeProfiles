       ** Price Waterhouse Coopers - Comply First Time**  
PwC engaged SSW to help redevelop their flagship business tax reporting and compliance platform that was originally built on top of Access and SQL server. SSW modernized and re-architected the platform to be web based and built on good enterprise practices.   

Since successfully launching Comply First Time to a client base of some of Australia's largest companies, SSW has helped PwC expand the capabilities of their product to also encompass other areas of compliance like Employment Taxes and Worker's Compensation.   

We've also helped PwC take this product global, brining it into the Malaysian, New Zealand, Swiss and other European jurisdictions. This platform has also been chosen as the standard global platform for PwC indirect taxes (initially there were many competing products developed internally by other PwC divisions)

PDS is a long time client with SSW. We helped develop their ruggedized mobile application for dealing with Asset management, Inspections and Wear Management at mining sites. We also helped build their flagship Windows Forms application managing the same systems. More recently we helped PDS migrate their Windows Forms application to the web with a new MVC website, using WebAPIs. This allowed us to make the application cross platform and tablet ready.

Energetics were looking towards SSW to take over the development of their existing One2Five web application from their previous vendor. We conducted a software audit, migration to .NET 4.0, code clean-up involving merging two separate code bases for English and Japanese into the one globalized version and implemented a many enhancements and bug fixes to streamline the use of the web application for facilitators and administrators. We implemented features into their offline Windows Forms application to bring it to parity with the web application and implemented a ClickOnce deployment mechanism for easier delivery. We worked using the scrum methodology and consistently met deadlines and delivered extra functionality.
