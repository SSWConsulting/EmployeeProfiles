Gordon is a SSW Solution Architect and has been a Microsoft MVP since 2014 for Developer Technologies.

He's uber passionate about helping people really understand DevOps and how they approach their problems with a DevOps mindset.

He's used the Microsoft stack for many years starting with .net 2.0 in 2008. He's worked with Azure DevOps since the early on-premises TFS days and used the cloud version since available as tfpreview. 

He's co-authored many guidance docs as part of the ALM Rangers, written 2 books on Customization TFS and a co-authored of Managing Agile Open-Source Software Projects with Visual Studio Online (now Azure DevOps Services).

When he's not pushing technology limits you'll find him training for the next swim/bike/run event or relaxing with his family. 

You can connect with him on his [social platforms](https://gordonbeeming.com/) or take a look at his [YouTube channel (@gordonbeeming)](https://www.youtube.com/@gordonbeeming) to see what he's playing with currently.
