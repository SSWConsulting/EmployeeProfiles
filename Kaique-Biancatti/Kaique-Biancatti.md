Kiki is one of those rare SysAdmins who is a Powershell Guru. He has been a Systems Analyst at SSW for many years, and he has taken some of our processes from horse and carriage to more Tesla-like. He has supercharged SSW clients using PowerShell, Power Apps, Power Automate (was Microsoft Flow) and Zendesk. 
 
He has a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and many years of experience working as a Customer Experience Analyst before tackling greater things, giving him the necessary skill-set to give SSW clients the best possible customer service and support.
This includes helping many clients transform their customer service - generally from using a shared mailbox - to getting top-of-the-line reporting, ticketing and automation tools with Zendesk, which SSW is partner with.
 
When Kiki Biancatti is not automating SSWâ€™s processes, he is working with his bread and butter, using Windows and Windows Server, Active Directory, Networking, Office 365 applications, Azure, Teams, Skype, automation, hardware maintenance and plenty more!
