Jonty is a creative, skilled, and a versatile individual with production experience in digital media across mutliple playforms and channels. 

Jonty is highly capable of working effectively with teams, customers, and stakeholders. Over the years, Jonty has grown to intimately understand peopleâ€™s needs and expectations, the importance of collaborating, and value open and honest communication.

Jonty has a rich set of skills and experience drawn form working with established businesses across multiple industries, including: the wedding industry, film industry, childcare industry, and the education industry.

Like the rest of the team at SSW, he believes in striving for excellence and having the humility to realise there is always room to grow.

In the order to achieve the best results you need to strive to be the best version of yourself - that's why when he's not in the office you can find Jonty working on his filmmaking craft, running a half-marathon, or praticing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
