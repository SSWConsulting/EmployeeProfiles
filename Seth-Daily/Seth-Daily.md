Seth is an SSW Marketing Assistant and Account Manager. He has an interest in artificial intelligence and its applications for creativity and productivity. He's always making the best prompts for ChatGPT and Midjourney and stays up to date on the latest AI techniques. He likes contributing to [SSW Rules](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/) because the ultimate goal is optimization of everything, and in pursuit of that grand design, best practices are the most advanced blueprint that we have.

He also contributes in other ways, from marketing initiatives to organizing [events](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Events/?tech=all&type=all) and learning account management skills under the guidance of [Uly](https://www.ssw.com.au/people/uly/).


He grew up in the United States, lived for a stint in Switzerland, and is now creating a second home in Australia. In his free time he practices martial arts, plays music, and enjoys surfing - which he likes so much that he has done it in 4 continents and is now based in the great surfing region of Newcastle.
