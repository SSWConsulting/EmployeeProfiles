Seth is an SSW Marketing Assistant and Account Manager who loves artificial intelligence and applying it for productivity.

⌛ He makes time-saving tools using ChatGPT and other AI, and follows the AI world closely.

📏 He likes improving [SSW Rules](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/) because best practice standards optimize every process.

🎊 He contributes to the [SSW Website](https://www.ssw.com.au/), organizes [events](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Events/?tech=all&type=all) and is learning account management under the guidance of [Uly](https://www.ssw.com.au/people/uly/).

🌎 Raised in California, he has lived in Switzerland and now his second home is Australia.

🎓 In his free time he is always learning - martial arts, guitar and piano, and surfing (which might be why he lives in the great surfing region of Newcastle 😏)
