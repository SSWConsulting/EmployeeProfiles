Luke has spent the last 15 years in the Fintech and Paytech industry, designing and building software solutions that are used by thousands of Australian businesses. He has worked closely with the ATO in many of their industry initiatives including SuperStream and Single Touch Payroll, and enjoys solving complex business processes in ways that make things easy for everyday users.

Luke has worked with .NET Framework since 2.0, and continues to follow the .NET and .NET Core development community closely. Having attended various SSW training courses and User Groups since 2008, he decided to make the jump to SSW in 2022. His favourite tech stack is .NET WebAPIs coupled with SPA front-ends; specifically Angular and Blazor.

When he's not working, Luke can be found around Sydney playing music, running TTRPG sessions and mentoring junior developers.
