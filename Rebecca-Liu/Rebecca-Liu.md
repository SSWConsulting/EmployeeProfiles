Rebecca is an UX/UI expert at SSW. She loves typography, bold colors and attention to minutiae. She believes strongly in the marriage of form *and* function that composes the entirety of Design. She sees UX as an extension of psychology. The best Web designs are reflections of existing human interactions – so we use terms like “Shopping Cart” and not made-up words like Gizzleborp.

She has been making websites for almost 20 years, buying her own domain at 16. She has watched Web Design bloom from revolutionary into conventional and has learned to evolve with a fast paced industry.

She has worked on a variety of in-house SSW projects as well as big and small clients, including Sydney Airport, Toll, Carnival Australia, Johnson and Johnson, Allianz and Aecom.

She plays Dungeons and Dragons in her spare time.
