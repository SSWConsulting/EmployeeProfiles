Rebecca is a Graphic Designer at SSW. She loves typography, bright color palettes and attention to small details. She is camera shy and doesn't like talking about herself.

She has worked on a variety of in-house SSW projects as well as big and small clients. Some of her clients are:

*   **Peters of Kensington**  
A large online shopping website that needed a complete redesign from the bottoms up. Rebecca worked with a team of designers to tackle this one, but all the credit should be given to Eric who tamed this beast. He is knighted The Dragonslayer, but they never get around to the ceremony.  

*   **CBF Lawyers**  
One week to design and implement a custom SharePoint intranet? Who can do it? We can do it! 
        

*   **SSW Metro**  
This is her White Whale. It might also have been the most difficult project she's ever had to do. What a lot of people don't realise was that the redesign of the site was predominantly a one man job. Blood, sweat and tears went into the creation of SSW Metro. Mostly tears. Actually, there was a lot of tears. Still, it's her baby. It's not perfect but she likes it. You can view the [SSW web guideline](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/consulting/typographyguide.aspx) to see some of the underwork of the site.  

*   **Sydney Airport**  
Designing and building a wizard to help investors calculate their tax returns for 2012. "Give it to us fast and dirty," they said. That sounds rude. In actuality, there was very little rudeness involved.  

*   **Toll Transport**  
 Rebecca loves working for Toll. "This is a web application to track our truck registry," they said, "it's a small job." Turns out, it wasn't small. Still everything went better than expected. Feedback from users: "I love it! It's so fast and I actually know what I'm doing!" Happy users is a happy designer. She can't take credit for the speed though. Well done, devs.  

*   **Grovenor/WEBCM**  
This is a contract management system. It's an extension of what they already do, but now they want to build a web app and market it as a separate company. Fair enough. "Don't worry about the logo, we're going to get an external design company to- hey wait, did you design that dummy logo? We like it. Let's use that." Okay.  

Three months later she has another job to design a theme for the Wordpress web site for their app - she loves this client. They asked for her by name. That makes her all warm and fuzzy on the inside. However it's dreadful timing and she's already booked for the later half. It's okay, we'll just hand the design to Tiago who'll build it. Tiago is Wordpress savvy - he's like a Wordpress Pirate. Arr, me hearties.  

*   **Skylr**  
Keith, the guy from Toll, tells SSW he needs a designer for a little project he's doing on the side. This is the second time she gets asked for by name. The fame goes straight to her head. She decides to buy a boat. She changes her mind soon after. However she does design a web application for Skylr, a shift management system for small businesses. This is the most amount of work she's ever done for a two day spec. She goes on a sabbatical.  

She likes pie, sleeping in, reading, gaming, playing with the cat, yelling at the cat, chasing the cat and potatoes. She doesn't really take herself seriously. She saves all of that for her work.
