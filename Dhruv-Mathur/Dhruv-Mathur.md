## Projects

### SugarLearning

Dhruv has been crucial in advancing the technology behind SugarLearning, particularly in its shift to .NET 8. His work involved making the system more efficient, strengthening its security, and adding new features that make it simpler for users to navigate. He also transitioned the application's user identity checks to IdentityServer, which separated the authentication process from the main application, enhancing both security and functionality. Additionally, Dhruv upgraded the application's front-end, moving it from Angular version 8 to the latest version 17, significantly improving the user interface and experience.

### SSW.Identity

Dhruv has contributed significantly to the development of SSW.Identity, our dedicated identity server utilizing Duende IdentityServer and .NET 8. His efforts were focused on customizing the user interface for the SignUp/SignIn processes, tailoring them to each client application for a personalized experience. Additionally, he was responsible for configuring the authentication settings specifically for SugarLearning, ensuring seamless integration and functionality.
