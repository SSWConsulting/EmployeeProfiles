## Internal Projects

### SSW SugarLearning

Dhruv has played a key part in maintaining SugarLearning and migrating it to .NET 8 with amazing new features. This is our own Learning Management System (LMS) that we've built to make online learning better. It is now running on .NET 8 with the latest features, showing our dedication to using the latest technology in education.

### SSW.Identity

Dhruv has also done work on SSW.Identity, our own identity server. This server, which is based on Duende IdentityServer and built using .NET 8, acts as the central sign-in point for all our internal apps. It's what makes single sign-on (SSO) possible for us, streamlining access across our various applications.
