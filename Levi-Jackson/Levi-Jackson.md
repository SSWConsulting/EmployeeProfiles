Levi is an SSW Account Manager located in Sydney, Australia.

Specializing in Business Development and Account Management, Levi works with the SSW sales team to help promote and advance the growth of our NSW clientele. He is driven by his passion for business development and technology, and thrives on problem-solving with his "out of the box" mindset.

Levi will be actively involved in the initial stages of your new project and will conduct an initial meeting to discuss your company's requirements while assessing which of our brilliant developers are best suited to your project. At this stage, a Team of talented developers work together to build a plan for the project ahead, which we call the Specification Review. Finally, using the Specification Review outcome as a roadmap, our top-tier Solution Architects will guide the production team through the new solution, every step of the way, while Levi will continue to ensure the project is running smoothly and the communication is flowing freely.

In his free time, Levi loves to travel and explore new places around the world, immersing himself in different cultures and cuisines. He's also fascinated by the potential of AI and enjoys utilizing the power of ChatGPT. Levi is also a passionate car enthusiast and finds the process of assembling and testing engines to be both challenging and rewarding.
