Adam is passionate about building awesome teams and software projects.

He loves people, patterns, processes and technology: Azure, MVC, Scrum, clean code, dependency injection, tests, continuous delivery, training, mentoring and presenting.

Adam believes communication and agility lead to success: 'fail fast', inspect, adapt, have a lot of fun. 

Adam loves a puzzle. His favourite is how to transform complex business requirements into working software, delivered incrementally, while educating and co-ordinating team members and stakeholders.
