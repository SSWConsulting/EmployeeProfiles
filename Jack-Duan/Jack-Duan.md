Jack is a Software Architect who is passionate about emerging technologies. After graduating from Uni, he created a mobile app using Flutter, Firebase, and Google cloud function. With his expertise in SQL database, OAuth 2.0 and GCP, Jack is able to build applications that require both performance and security.



Apart from mobile application development, Jack has great knowledge of web development and the .NET framework. He is excellent at turning business logic into web applications. If you want to reduce the cost of inner work, Jack would be the best resource to take.



Being a big fan of Carl Popper and David Hume, Jack is supercritical of everything, including himself! He knows functional programming is equally 'bad' as OOP. That is to say, when contributing to an extensive library, Jack knows how to code high-quality code using both OOP and functional programming.



In his spare time, Jack makes fancy jewellery pieces, and he has been super passionate about 3D printing houses recently.
