Penny is usually described as SSW's "Chef Problem Solver" (that's what you'll see on her signiture). She is the go-to person if you ever need help, or if you have a problem you cannot solve. Penny is multiskilled, and very adapatable, which allows her to work across a few different teams. She has a background in Administration and Marketing, and has more recently joined our Sales team.  

 Penny has a lot of positive energy and strong people skills, so she is also the face of SSW recruitment. She seeks the best people to expand our awesome SSW family, and helps them settle in with a unique on-boarding experience.
