Ozair is an innovative SSW Software Developer based in the Melbourne office, known for his unique blend of technical prowess and problem-solving skills. Holding a Master's in Network Systems with a specialization in Cyber Security from Swinburne University, he excels in both front-end and back-end development, with a particular focus on Angular, React, and .NET technologies.
<br/><br/>
In a recent challenge, Ozair and his team were tasked with migrating a large-scale project from .NET Framework to .NET 8. They wanted to avoid a feature freeze and reduce risk by ensuring old parts of the app were retired as soon as possible. To accomplish this feat, they utilized a reverse proxy (YARP) to run both versions in tandem, allowing for a seamless transition and immediate use of new features.
<br/><br/>
Ozair has also significantly impacted operational efficiencies in various sectors. For example, on one of his projects, the client was utilizing a physical document to assign tasks to people. He worked with the client to move these tasks into a web app, eliminating the need for physical documents. This solution meant the client could track and manage tasks in real-time. Moreover, the client had a level of transparency and efficiency that was previously unattainable.
