Bahjat is the Multimedia Specialist & Videographer in the SSW TV team.

For the better part of two decades Bahjat has been driven by capturing stories from around the world, which means he enjoys a good chat about personal exploration. 

His Digital Motion Picture degree 🎥 gave him a foundation for filmmaking that enables him to make critical decisions on site or in a studio setting, to ensure a safe and comfortable work environment.

Bahjat is also a Macgyver-esc on-set ninja 🥷 with film industry training and experience. His world travels have given him a global perspective and a rambunctious imagination which leaves no challenge unexplored. He aspires to motivate, inspire and benefit those around him to attain what they're passionate about.

Bahjat is also passionate about his project car 🏎️, fencing 🤺 (the sport with the sword 😁) and trying to fix most anything 🛠️. All this while trying to wrangle four kids 🤪
