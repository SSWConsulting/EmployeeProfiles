Andreas is currently doing work experience at SSW. He is doing a Masters of Computer Science in Germany but decided to go abroad and gain additional experience before finishing his studies.   
One of his projects at SSW is the development of SSW Sophie, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) which will greet customers and show valuable information to them.   

In his spare time, Andreas likes to read a good sci-fi book, do a bike tour or cook something delicious.
