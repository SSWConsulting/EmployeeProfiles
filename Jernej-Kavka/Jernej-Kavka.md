With 10 years of experience in software engineering across multiple industries like Museums, Government, Banks, gaming, entertainment, Jernej has worked on full stack development of native applications from mobile to desktop applications.

JK loves working on Angular, .NET Core, and cognitive service and his most recent projects have featured Docker and AKS (Azure Kubernetes Services). He now loves containers and sees everything as a container!  

He is often a contributor, preparing developers for their SSW TV presentations and even gets in front of the camera sometimes [https://tv.ssw.com/tag/jernej-kavka](https://tv.ssw.com/tag/jernej-kavka) and [Personal YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VPHV1902OQ&list=PLO0Fq_pphtfEHluXtyaX-IYy4vV2QxYeS) or at events like [Global Azure Bootcamp ](https://global.azurebootcamp.net/)or [DDD](https://dddbrisbane.com/). He also actively supports .NET Community as a [.NET Foundation member](https://dotnetfoundation.org/) (one of the first 200 members!) and is a backer for several Open Source projects on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/jernej-kavka).  

You can also follow me on [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/jernej_kavka)and [my personal dev blog](https://jkdev.me/).  
You can find his schedule for the next presentation on [Sessionize](https://sessionize.com/jernej-kavka/).
