Matt is a solution architect based at SSW's Sydney office. He has been developing solutions using the full Microsoft stack since .NET 2 was in beta.  

Matt has had experience in the finance sector with: 

*   Dynamics CRM  

*   PABX systems
*   B2B integrations (including direct entry bank entry APIs)

Matt likes clean OO designs, seeing a project with suites of passing unit tests, Selenium automation and sometimes he still reminisces about WebForms.
