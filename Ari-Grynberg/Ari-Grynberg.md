As the Chief Property Officer at SSW, I am committed to ensuring that every aspect of our property management—ranging from routine maintenance and urgent repairs to planned upgrades and strategic relocations—is handled with precision and efficiency. My role involves overseeing all property-related matters across our offices, including periodic site visits to stay attuned to the needs of each location.

With a robust background in project management, estimation, supervision, negotiations, and quality control, I am adept at navigating the complexities of construction and maintenance projects. Whether dealing with straightforward tasks or intricate, time-consuming projects, my focus is always on preemptive planning and safeguarding SSW’s interests to deliver optimal outcomes.

Based in Sydney, I will be working from our Sydney office while making it a point to visit each SSW location over time. Outside of work, I enjoy immersing myself in nature, indulging in water activities, and keeping up with sports, especially cricket. As a passionate sports fan, I am also an advocate for the return of the Bears. Additionally, I stay engaged with current affairs and politics. I am a father to three teenage children and share my home with two lively dogs.

Feel free to connect with me to discuss property matters or just to share your thoughts on sports and current events!
