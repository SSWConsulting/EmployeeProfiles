 I'm a full stack web developer with extensive experience developing enterprise software in ASP.NET MVC and SQL Server.

 What sets me apart is my focus on User Experience. I don't just make it work, I make it work beautifully with careful thought going into everything from front end design to performance on the back end.

 To compliment my Microsoft web development skills, I also have great experience with other web technologies and I'm a very active community speaker. I just love to make videos.

I'm also quite into startups and have plenty of experience with rapid prototyping, especially in the payments space.

 In my spare time you'll find me having a cold beer and tinkering with the latest technologies. At the moment I'm building some cross platform mobile applications using [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/).  

I also have a beer brewing channel on youtube: [Mash Hacks](https://www.youtube.com/user/mashhacks).
