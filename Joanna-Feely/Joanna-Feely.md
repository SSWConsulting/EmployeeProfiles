Joanna's role at SSW is Personal Assistant to Chief Architect Adam Cogan, as well as the day-to-day running of the office. She helps organise SSW training events and User Groups, and also puts together the regular newsletter that is distributed to company friends and clients to keep them in the loop with what's happening at SSW.  

She is loving getting to use her eye for detail, strong organisational skills, and knowledge of HTML in a friendly office atmosphere.
